Start:
You wake up on a beach, groggy, and you have a big headache.  It hurts so bad, your vision is blurry.  You shivver with the cold, as you look around and get your surroundings.
You find yourself on a stoney beach, the cold ocean stretching out far beyond your sight to the West.
Behind you to the East, beyond the rocky shore, is the treeline.  Evergreens and low shrubs grow everywhere.
North along the beach, you can see a small cove, with lots of driftwood gathered on the shore.  South along the beach is more empty, rocky beach.

1.  Go West to the water, and check for any supplies that may have washed up with you.
2.  Go North to the cove.
3.  Go East to the treeline.
