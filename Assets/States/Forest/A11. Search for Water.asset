  storyText: "Looking around for water, you eventually find a small, clear, running
    stream, and kneel down, taking a small drink.  You decide that tomorrow, you'll
    look for food, and figure out a way to carry water back to the cove, so you don't
    have to walk up here for every sip.  You make your way back to your camp, and
    settle down for sleep.  You're cold, but you're alive.\r\n\r\n1.  Go to the next
    day.\n\n(NEXT AREA UNDER DEVELOPMENT, you will be sent to main menu)"
