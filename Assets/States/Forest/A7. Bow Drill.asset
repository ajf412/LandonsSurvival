  storyText: "You're a smart boy!  Knowing that you're smaller, and not exactly very
    strong yet (because you're only 6 years old!) you decide to go with the bow drill,
    as it will require less effort to start a fire.  Using your shoestring a couple
    of long sticks and a rock, you fashion a bow drill, and set to making the ember
    in your notch.  You soon have a blazing fire that dries your clothes and warms
    your body.\r\n\r\n1.  Search for food.\r\n\r\n2.  Go to sleep.\r\n\r\n3.  Search
    for water."
