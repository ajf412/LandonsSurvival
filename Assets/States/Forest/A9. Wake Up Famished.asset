  storyText: 'Your eyes are peeled open by the hunger in your belly, and the thirst
    in your dry mouth.  A chill wiggles its way down your back as you slowly sit up
    to look at your dying fire.  You add some bits of wood and stoke it back to life,
    and finally rid your body of the chill after a few minutes.  You are tired, wore
    out, and still a little cold.


    1.  Find food.


    2.  Find Water.


    3.  Build a shelter.
