  storyText: "You decide to use a fire plough to make your fire.  You get a nice hardwood
    stick for your plow, and some softwood for your base.  You set the wood to work,
    pushing, rubbing, pushing, rubbing, pushing, rubbing...  It takes hours, but finally,
    you see a ribbon of smoke, but then it goes out.  More pushing, rubbing, pushing,
    rubbing... another ribbon of smoke that you finally nurture into a healthy little
    flame, and eventually, a comfortable, roaring fire.  You are cold and tired, but
    now finally warming up.  You slowly drift off to sleep in front of your fire.\r\n\r\n1.
    \ Go to the next day."
