  storyText: "You wake up on a beach, groggy, and you have a big headache.  It hurts
    so bad, your vision is blurry.  You shivver with the cold as you look around and
    get your surroundings.\r\nYou find yourself on a stoney beach, the cold ocean
    stretching out far beyond your sight to the West.\r\nBehind you to the East, beyond
    the rocky shore, is the treeline.  Evergreens and low shrubs grow everywhere.\r\nNorth
    along the beach, you can see a small cove, with lots of driftwood gathered on
    the shore.  South along the beach is more empty, rocky beach.\r\n\r\n1.  Go West
    to the water, and check for any supplies that may have washed up with you.\r\n2.
    \ Go North to the cove.\r\n3.  Go East to the treeline."
